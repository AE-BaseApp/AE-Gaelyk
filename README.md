[GAE-Gaelyk](http://gae-gaelyk.appspot.com) - Groovy / Gaelyk / Google App Engine Base App
==============================================

GAE-Gaelyk Base-App
-------------------

[Give-A-Shout](http://give-a-shout.appspot.com) is a multi-platform app-engine example base-app created by 
Mark Finch to assist developers looking to build their first applications 
leveraging Google's Cloud Infrastructure. Give-A-Shout is loosely based 
on the video from Brett Slatkin introducing Google App Engine at 
[Google IO 2008](http://sites.google.com/site/io/).

The GAE-Gaelyk version of Give-A-Shout uses the Groovy Language along with 
the Gaelyk Framework to provide the same functionality as the original 
Python version.
